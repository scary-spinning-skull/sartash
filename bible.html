<p>The Bible of the non-Catholic lizardmen has been amended in various ways to make it more compatible with lizardman culture and values. Additionally, there is a seventeenth book wherein a traveler named Hashk of Etsekhh meets Jesus and learns about the geography and customs of Israel as its author imagined it, e.g.:

</div>

<div class="b">

<p>17:14 Hashk said to Jesus, I am a traveler here and wish to see Kateru [Capernaum]; where is it?

<p>17:15 Jesus said, Kateru is ten <i>tetec</i> (60 miles) to the north of Cherusla [Jerusalem] on the shores of the sea.

<p>17:16 Now Hashk said, am I permitted to travel abroad on the seventh day, which is the day of rest?

<p>17:18 Jesus told him, humans must rest on the Sabbath, but not the green men, who are doubly blessed.

</div>

<div class="a">

<p> And so on. Other amendments include:

<p>Various unknown mammals mentioned in the book are changed to local fauna. The camel of 10:25 becomes a triceratops, for example.

<p>The man with the crippled hand in 3:1-5 is specified to be a lizardman. 3:6 is amended to say that the spies are angered because aiding lizardmen is contrary to the law of Cherusla.

<p>The Greek mother in 7:26 becomes a female nest-warden.

<p>Jesus tears flesh from his body and pours blood from his veins to feed his disciples at the Passover feast in book 14, repeating the miraculous feeding of the masses in chapter 6 and implicitly sanctioning cannibalism. When Judas objects, Jesus reminds him of his words in 7:18-23.

<p>Jesus' exclamation in 15:34 is translated into a high register of contemporary Valley Lizardmannish rather than Hebrew, and dramatic detials are slipped into later verses.
</div>

<div class="b">

<p>15:34 And he roared, "Ek Teke Ilkhh, sik'a xalkess ikh tsash kse?" The warriors of Cherusla were frightened.

<p>15:39-40 The temple was destroyed by lightning and fire. The human priests threw themselves from their towers, and their bodies were eaten by raptors.

This is a short text which expands on the dialogue with Hashk of Etsekhh to explain certain details, placing special emphasis on the nature of angels and the differences between them and demons. Interestingly, Jesus makes some provocative claims about the honored position of lizardmen in Heaven:

</div>

<div class="b">

<p>2:18 "All humans speak the language of the green men in Heaven, for that was the first and finest language ever devised."

<p>2:34-36 "Green men alone enter Heaven through the main gate, and all are led in straightaway, but the humans must wait by a smaller gate."
