<p>There are a number of areas in the New Canaan region which are heavily irradiated. These include the oldest ruined cities, but also areas which, if the characters have any experience mining, were clearly the site of strip mining operations in the distant past. Magic-users also like to build lead-lined strongholds in such areas, as the radiation can enhance their spellcasting abilities.

<br>

<p>Exposure to this environmental hazard is inimical to the health of normal characters and creatures. Characters have some natural ability to resist radiation: Radiation Resistance, which is calculated by adding a character's level and their CON score. For example, a level 3 magic-user with a CON score of 8 has a natural RR of 11. Magic-user characters enjoy a +2 bonus to their RR score, so this hypothetical character's actual RR is 13. Wearing metal armor confers an additional +1 to RR for each point of AC protection conferred by that equipment, and the Level 2 MU/Cleric spell <i>Block Radiation</i> adds +5 to all radiation checks for its duration.

<br>

<p>Radiation comes at three levels, noted as 1R, 2R, 3R, and 4R. When calculating the amount of radiation a party is exposed to during each check, the DM secretly rolls 1d6+1d6 for each level of radiation. If the radiation check exceeds a character's RR, they receive a dose of radiation which lowers their RR by 1. When that score reaches 0, the character's loses 1 HP and 1 CON every three hours. A character whose RR bottoms out but continues to explore an irradiated ruin for the next 27 hours will lose 9HP and 9 CON; if the character's CON bottoms out at 1, the loss to HP accelerates to 1 point per hour unless the character receives aid through magical or alchemical means. Resting does <b>not</b> improve a character's condition or slow the effects of radiation; a character who rests for three hours in this condition will wake up with an HP that has <i>decreased</i> by 3.

<br>

<p>Characters can recover from radiation exposure over time. For every week outside of the irradiated area, their HP and CON rises by 1d3 until reaching their original level. RR rises more slowly, increasing by only 1 point a week. <i>Cure Disease</i> can increase RR by 1 point at any time, although the salubrious effects of this if a character is still in an irradiated area are slight at best. Those who took more then 3HP of damage have some permanent disfigurement - scars from old skin lesions, patches of hair missing, etc - that permanently drop their CHA by 1.
