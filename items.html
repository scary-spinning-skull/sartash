There are countless magical items found throughout the land. Some are of human manufacture, some are made by lizardmen, and some are of unknown origin.

<center><u><font size="+1">Detection Statuette</font></u></center>

<br><br>

A small statuette of Christ made of an incredibly light ivory-colored material. There is a WIS+50% chance of the statuette flashing a light and issuing a warning when <a href="biosignatures.wav">openly hostile non-Christians are approaching</a> the possessor of the statue. The statuette can also trigger <a href="schismatic.wav">when schismatics are near</a>, hostile or no (50%), or <a href="satanicactivity.wav">when Satanists or their magical works</a> are nearby (80%).

<br><br>

A small loop along the  back of the idol allows the owner to wear it as a necklace. There are three settings: On, Mute, and Off. The statue's light flashes in Mute mode but does not speak, and it becomes inert when changed to Off.
