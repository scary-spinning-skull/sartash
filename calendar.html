<p>
Party is "executed" in Westfordshire, England and arrives at the (0,0) portal, where they take in the blue-green plant life, yellowish sky, and red-tinged sun and first conclude that they are either in Purgatory or Hell. They explore a small nearby fort and discover a massacre. The party moves "west" (actually north) to avoid the perpetrators of the massacre, and, because they have now changed their minds and decided that they are in the Holy Land, to find the Mediterranean coast, where fellow Christians will bring them home to England.
<br>

Party attempts to rob a caravan of scaly, green skinned, and tail-having Moors, but it goes poorly and Matt is beaten unconscious by the caravan's guards and held hostage until his comrades surrender five iron nails (250gp), and they are given one glazed pot in a mocking imitation of a trade. The Moors go on their way, looking somewhat bloodied but far richer than when they set out. The party follows the south bank of the river in the hopes of reaching the Mediterranean, where they expect to find fellow Christians and return to England.

Western River discovered. A group of "barbarian" Moors visit the camp at night but are intimidated by the Englishmen (and Scot) and leave. Party chooses to follow the river west.
<!-- <p>(Lizardman caravan arrives at St. Irene (2,0) and reports their encounter; 6 member contact team dispatched immediately, seven member team dispatched to (0,0) to find out why the newcomers were not being escorted. <p>Tribal raiders arrive at their camp at the ruin of the temple of Karchak at (-1,-3). Barbarian lizardmen encountered on 8/31 are massacred by raiders at (-2,1). -->

The river turns north, and a treeline is visible off to the west. A herd of bone-skulled animals gets too close to camp that night and one is successfully hunted and killed. More meat is recovered, and the party is finally eating well after several days of hunger. However, everyone in the party but Tom wakes up violently ill. A group consisting of Br. Peter of Romania and two grizzled fighters arrive and, after seeing the state they're in, casts <i>Neutralize Poison</i> on the party. The Cleric watches closely after he's recovered, and he also watches as Peter uses <i>Purify Food and Water</i> to make the pachycephalosaur edible. Now with a guide and two guards, the party turns around and begins traveling downstream to St. Irene.

<p>
That night at camp in (-3,1), Peter questions the party and is told that they were innocent explorers who accidentally fell into a portal. He buys this, and afterwards he talks a member of the party into handing over a "relic" to be "studied" by his brothers at the monastery. Everyone else realizes that the victim has been scammed, and herbivores browse near the camp that night, but the guard wisely chooses not to hunt any.

<!-- <p>(The seven-man team arrives at the (0,0) fort and discovers the massacre there. After spending the night of 9/03 nearby, they begin their return to St. Irene. -->

In the morning, Peter presses them for some more information about their activities and tells them that the Moors who arrived in St. Irene were the ones who alerted the city to their arrival. Their account of the encounter on 8/30 is vastly different from what the Moors said, but they are heathens and therefore not as credible. The party arrives at (0,0) and discovers that the contact team has buried the bodies, gathered most of the remaining valuables, and returned to St. Irene. There was some discussion of occupying the fort overnight or marching through the dark in hopes of reaching St. Irene by dawn, but the party chooses the latter, saying, "If twelve soldiers can't protect this place, then how can we?"

<!--A group of ten raiders and two prisoners leave the temple of Hlats and begin to retrace their steps to the fort, where the prisoners have promised them that there is more loot to be found). -->

<p>The party arrives at the gates of St. Irene. A rather unprofessional guard asks the party for an entry fee. After making their way through the oddly quiet streets to the monastery of St. Bononio, where they are fed and given a place to sleep. There is some trepidation when they discover that the news of the massacre at the fort has gone ahead of them, and a large crowd has gathered around the Abbess's basilica to demand that she sign off on a "crusade", but for now, it's not their problem. There are a number of thrilling jobs offered to the characters - farmer, adventurer, fisherman, relic hunter (which is different from adventurer in some ineffable way). The party decides to sleep on it.

<!-- 
<p>The fort's investigators arrive at St. Irene a few hours before the party, and the city's small army of crusaders begin clamoring for vengeance outside of the Basilica of Raphaela the Purifier.
<p>The raiders arrive at (0,0) and see that the area has been tidied up. The mass grave is dug up and the two remaining prisoners are impaled when it becomes obvious that there is no treasure. The building is then fired and they leave by noon, striking out for (1,-2). -->

When the party wakes up in the morning, they head an excited "crusader" badgering the monastery's doorman. There is agitation for a crusade picking up, and this young man is trying to talk monks into attending the rally to lend some religious legitimacy to the cause. When the group, especially Maurice, introduces themselves, the recruiter excitedly hustoes them to the rally. There they find Kruktog the Egg-Eater, quite clearly not a Christian convert, addressing the crowd from a hastily erected platform. "We tell you many year, Gazg have no moral! They kill and steal for no reason! You must fight, defend beautiful land!" Maurice climbs up the platform and addresses the crowd as well, trying his best but not doing as well as the heathen Moor at getting people fired up for a crusade.

<p>After guardsmen shoo the crowd away, Kruktog waylays the party and offers them a job. He knows of a place within marching distance where a wagonload of iron is slowly moving to its destination. In return for 5% of the iron and an advance payment of bronze arms and armor, Kruktog will give them the coordinates and an escort in an effort to recover the iron to aid his tribe in the coming war with the Gazg southerners. The party agrees and goes shopping to supplement the equipment that will be provided to them.

<p>After looking over some maps and acquainting themselves with the general geography of the area, they set out, hoping to camp out in various small towns for the nights that they'll be traveling. Most are unfriendly, but they reach a town with many Moorish converts and a small church, where they are given a belated communion and offer confession to the human priest who is stationed there.
