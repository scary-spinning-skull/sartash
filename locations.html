New arrivals from Earth are brought here and acclimated to life on their new world, and lizardmen, converts and pagans alike, choose to come here because they are able to find community and facilities far more easily than in other areas ruled by humans. The city is the namesake of the Abbey of St. Irene, which sits in the center of the city.

A party of raiders from the Gazg tribe established a camp on the site in early August 1300.</td>

<b><u><font size="+1"><center>What is "% to find"?</center></font></u></b>
<br>
<div class="a">This refers to the chance to find whatever the characters are looking for in a particular community. The specific listed percentage refers to weapons that are valued at 4 GP or under in the core rulebook. The players must roll at this number or lower if they want to find an item in the community for this week. This number drops by 5% for every additional 1 GP in value, but may fall further - or rise - depending on player actions in the community or faction, as merchants may find themselves being willing to take one last look in the stockroom etc if the group are people whom they like.</div>
