<center><u>Fortifying A Hex</u></center>

<br>

<p>Hexes can be "cleared" of enemy activity over time. Characters can personally sponsor soldiers (Fighter 1 human, 5sp daily) or prevail on a city or community to furnish levies, perhaps in exchange for performing some task. An officer of any class and level above 3 must also be hired (3sp per level daily).</p>

<p>Garrisons keep an area clear simply by being present. Forces which seek to enter it must exceed 25% of a garrison's HD. For example, 25 F1 soldiers with around 6HD would be able to hold a <a href="encounterpage.html#GiantSnake">giant snake</a> at bay, but they would have to battle a <a href="encounterpage.html#Spinosaurus">Spinosaurus</a>, which has 20HD. Players may assume the roles of "blank" (8-11 for all stats) fighters for the duration of the encounter. Unless they have been outfitted with superior equipment, half will be armed with simple bows and half will be armed with spears. Alternatively, players and the DM may use alternare rulesets for mass combat such as <i>One Hour Wargames</i> for larger engagements.</p>

<p>If hostile animals or people enter a garrisoned hex but have a total HD which is lower than 1/4 of the garrison, they are automatically repulsed and each soldier is awarded 50XP (in case a player would like to make one a PC later).</p>
