<p>
Party is "executed" in Westfordshire, England and arrives at the (0,0) portal, where they take in the blue-green plant life, yellowish sky, and red-tinged sun and first conclude that they are either in Purgatory or Hell. They explore a small nearby fort and discover a massacre. The party moves "west" (actually north) to avoid the perpetrators of the massacre, and, because they have now changed their minds and decided that they are in the Holy Land, to find the Mediterranean coast, where fellow Christians will bring them home to England.
<br>

<p>
Party attempts to rob a caravan of scaly, green skinned, and tail-having Moors, but it goes poorly and Matt is beaten unconscious by the caravan's guards and held hostage until his comrades surrender five iron nails (250gp), and they are given one glazed pot in a mocking imitation of a trade. The Moors go on their way, looking somewhat bloodied but far richer than when they set out. The party follows the south bank of the river in the hopes of reaching the Mediterranean, where they expect to find fellow Christians and return to England.

Western River discovered. A group of "barbarian" Moors visit the camp at night but are intimidated by the Englishmen (and Scot) and leave. Party chooses to follow the river west.

<hr>
<p><i>Lizardman caravan arrives at St. Irene (2,0) and reports their encounter; 6 member contact team dispatched immediately, seven member team dispatched to (0,0) to find out why the newcomers were not being escorted. <p>Tribal raiders arrive at their camp at the ruin of the temple of Karchak at (-1,-3). Barbarian lizardmen encountered on 8/31 are massacred by raiders at (-2,1).</i>

The river turns north, and a treeline is visible off to the west. A herd of bone-skulled animals gets too close to camp that night and one is successfully hunted and killed. More meat is recovered, and the party is finally eating well after several days of hunger. However, everyone in the party but Tom wakes up violently ill. A group consisting of Br. Peter of Romania and two grizzled fighters arrive and, after seeing the state they're in, casts <i>Neutralize Poison</i> on the party. The Cleric watches closely after he's recovered, and he also watches as Peter uses <i>Purify Food and Water</i> to make the pachycephalosaur edible. Now with a guide and two guards, the party turns around and begins traveling downstream to St. Irene.

<p>
That night at camp in (-3,1), Peter questions the party and is told that they were innocent explorers who accidentally fell into a portal. He buys this, and afterwards he talks a member of the party into handing over a "relic" to be "studied" by his brothers at the monastery. Everyone else realizes that the victim has been scammed, and herbivores browse near the camp that night, but the guard wisely chooses not to hunt any.
  
<hr>
  
<p><i>The seven-man team arrives at the (0,0) fort and discovers the massacre there. After spending the night of 9/03 nearby, they begin their return to St. Irene.</i>

In the morning, Peter presses them for some more information about their activities and tells them that the Moors who arrived in St. Irene were the ones who alerted the city to their arrival. Their account of the encounter on 8/30 is vastly different from what the Moors said, but they are heathens and therefore not as credible. The party arrives at (0,0) and discovers that the contact team has buried the bodies, gathered most of the remaining valuables, and returned to St. Irene. There was some discussion of occupying the fort overnight or marching through the dark in hopes of reaching St. Irene by dawn, but the party chooses the latter, saying, "If twelve soldiers can't protect this place, then how can we?"

<p>The party arrives at the gates of St. Irene. A rather unprofessional guard asks the party for an entry fee.

<hr>
  
<p><i>The fort's investigators arrive at St. Irene a few hours before the party, and the city's small army of crusaders begin clamoring for vengeance outside of the Basilica of Raphaela the Purifier when they hear news of what has happened.
<p>The raiders arrive at (0,0) and see that the area has been tidied up. When it becomes obvious that there is no more loot to be found, the prisoners are impaled on broken spears and the bodies from the mass grave are piled up at their feet. They then fire the building and leave at noon, striking out for (1,-2).</i>

<p><i>The raiding party arrives at the hunting grounds at (1,-2) and lose one of their number to river leeches before deciding to set up camp in the area and hunt pachycephalosaurs.</i>
