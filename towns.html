<br>
<p>When characters travel overland and try to bed in different communities, the characters must search a hex for several (1/2 day) hours unless the location of the village is already known. If a community is found, no encounter needs to be rolled for that period, e.g. if the party searches fruitlessly in the morning but finds it in the afternoon, they only have to make one encounter roll. If they fail to find anything by nightfall, or are not allowed to enter the town, they will have to make encounter checks for the day and the night as usual.
  
<p>When searching for a town, the DM must roll on three tables:
<br>
  
<center><u>Number of Communities</u></center>

<br>
This number varies depending on the type of environment one is in. Clearings are the default, while there is a -10 to such rolls in jungles, -15 in mountains, and -40 in ruins or pits.
