<center><b><u>Western River Battle</u></b></center>

<br><br>

A "tribal hunt" of 150 soldiers (100 soldiers, 50 cavalry) of Srak march south to cleanse the area of tribal raiders who have been making life difficult in the region for some time. While heading south, the army of Srak encountered a group of Gazg skirmishers camping on both sides of a tributary of the Western river. Three divisions of tribals were on the western side of the river, and one on the east. Steep hills bracketed the river in this area, and the armies were forced to fight on the narrow strips of land beside the river. After some initial progress, the Srak were pushed back.

Round 1 - Tribal forces are aware that the Sraks are marching south. Blindly, the Srak army is following the river, general Ts'ektal in the lead, confident in reports that the tribals are a day's march away.

<br>

Round 2 - The armies close.

<br>

Round 3 - Tribal Warband I rushes forward to pelt the enemy with javelins, but Division I and the general's cavalry close in and wipe out a significant portion of their unit. Tribal javelin attacks do nothing to dissuade the Srak units.

<br>

Round 4 & 5 - Javelin attacks intensify, and the Srak begin to take casualties. Division I takes especially heavy fire as it fords the river to engage Tribal Force IV, which is the only force on the south side.

<br>

Round 6 - Division I engages Tribal IV, while Division II destroys Tribal I and clears the way for the general's cavalry to press forth. The Tribal counterattack does little to dissuade them.

<br>

Round 7 - Tribal III is similarly engaged, and the General and Division II press forward to engage the fresh but shaken Tribal II. Tribal IV struggles with Division I.

<br>

Round 8 - Division II is beaten back.

<br>

Round 9 - Tribal II begins a blistering assault against the general, but the cavalry endures. Tribal IV fails to have an effect and is almost done for.

<br>

Round 10 - The cavalry is defeated. Tribal IV is likewise extinguished. Division I survives but is badly wounded. Rather than cross the river again to engage the remaining tribals, which would surely be futile, the Srak army decided to quit the field.

<b>FINAL</b>:

<br>

<ul>
<li>Srak:</li>
<li>Division 1: 2/15 52% dead = 9/15, 24 troops remaining</li>
<li>Division 2: 0/15 22% dead = 12/15, 39 troops</li>
<li>Cavalry: 0/15 16% dead = 13/15, 42 horse</li>
<li>Total: 30% dead</li>
</ul>

<br>

The infantry is limping and will have to call in aid to be an effective fighting force again. The cavalry has fared much better - not much more than the rearguard perished as the rest fled after seeing Division II defeated.

<br>

<ul>
<li>Tribal:</li>
<li>Tribal 1: 0/15 20% dead = 12/15, 40 warriors</li>
<li>Tribal 2: 7/15 38% dead = 9/15, 31 warriors</li>
<li>Tribal 3: 0/15 19% dead 12/15, 41 warriors</li>
<li>Tribal 4: 0/15 48% dead = 8/15, 26 warriors</li>
<li>Total: 31% dead</li>
</ul>

<br>

The tribal force is reduced by roughly a third. They may still be able to fight, but they are noticeably diminished and shaken by the experience. They hold the field for now, but it may be difficult for them to hold a force of similar strength at bay again.

<p>After the battle, 1d20×1d6 is rolled to determine the percentage of casualties which are dead rather than wounded. If there are any remaining troops in a unit, that number is subtracted from the 1d20 roll. Therefore, Division I's casualties above were calculated as 1d20-2×1d6. If the resultant number is greater than 100, it should be reduced, obviously.
