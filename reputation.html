When entering a new community or town, roll a 1d10 and add the result to whatever the "default" is for that town or faction.  For tribal lizardmen, this number will be 25, while the default is 50 for civilized communities. Christian communities, including communities of converted lizardmen, start at 75.

<td>16-30</td>
<td>As above, but hearts can be softened with enough groveling and bribes - 10gp per party member to the guards and city leadership will earn you fairer treatment. 5gp entry tax, 25% surcharge on all goods, -1 to attitude rolls during encounters.</td>

<td>31-55</td>
<td>Treated with polite disdain. Party may rest in town for two nights, no longer. Token entry tax demanded, 15% surcharge on all goods unless there is a lizardman in the party - then it is merely 10%. Helpers found in town will demand a "bonus" up front in addition to their regular pay.</td>

<td>A good egg. Townslizards are happy to see you, and several days of free lodging are offered. A retainer, a warrior-in-training, will be offered for one blue month (twelve days) free of charge on the assurance that he will be allowed to experience some combat, and three tribeslizards are willing to accompany you for three days. If the retainer comes home dead, you will lose 5 reputation points in that specific community. +3 to attitude rolls.</td>
