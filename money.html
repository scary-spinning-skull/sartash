<div class="a">This refers to the chance to find whatever the characters are looking for in a particular community. The specific listed percentage refers to weapons that are valued at 4 GP or under in the core rulebook. The players must roll at this number or lower if they want to find an item in the community for this week. This number drops by 5% for every additional 1 GP in value, but may fall further - or rise - depending on player actions in the community or faction, as merchants may find themselves more (or less) willing to take one last look in the stockroom if the group is well-liked.

Iron is rare on Sartash and literally worth its weight in gold. 1 lb of iron = 50 gp. Other metals are more common, and most arms and armor are made from bronze. While they are as effective as their steel counterparts, they break easily. All bronze tools and weapons have a 50% chance of breaking on a fumble, and armor has a 75% chance of losing 1 AC of protective power upon a critical strike. Unless noted otherwise, <i>all</i> arms and armor are made from bronze.

Blacksmithing is a difficult process, and there are few who have experience in it - most such people are from Earth, and they charge a premium for their skills. Listed prices for steel and iron items should be multiplied by twenty. Therefore, a 6 gp axe will cost 120 gp; an 80 gp byrnie now fetches 1600 gp.

Characters who pay in copper may find that smiths are more willing to produce new armor for you, treating copper as raw material. In exchange for saving him the trouble of having to purchase the raw material himself, he may offer a 10% discount.

All coins have weight. Copper and silver pieces, CP and SP, weigh 1/100th of a pound, i.e. 100 coppers is one pound in a character's inventory. Gold pieces, GP, weigh 1/20th of a pound.

<br><br>

Gems have negligible weight. However, they are far more likely to attract wandering eyes - pickpockets, rapacious gate guards, and unscrupulous merchants may claim that they can't "make change" for such valuable objects (per the outcome of a secret roll by the DM).
